- Case we are using NextJS, always prefer TS instead of JS. Use JS only if the file requires. Feel free to use CJS or MJS when needed too.
- Always check for existing interfaces and types and constants, before creating new ones.
- Always try to decouple functions that might be reusable, constants and interfaces as well, centralizing them.
- Always use the d.ts format for the interfaces and types.
