# xmem.xyz - Memory Management for LLMs

Welcome to xmem.xyz! This is a simple, open-source tool designed to help you manage context and memory for large language models (LLMs). It allows you to store and persist multiple memory entries, tagged with relevant labels, which can then be copied and used as context for new conversations. This is perfect for improving LLM interactions by reducing hallucinations and increasing performance.

## How it Works

The core functionality is simple yet powerful:
- **Create Memory Entries**: Add your thoughts, experiences, or facts to the system. Each entry can be tagged with up to 3 relevant tags (e.g., Technology, Skills, Learning).
- **Persist the Memories**: Each entry is saved so that you can retain context for future interactions.
- **Copy Your Data**: With one click, you can copy all of your saved memories into your clipboard in JSON format. This can then be used as input to any LLM for context.

## Key Features

- **Add Memories**: Enter your thoughts and tag them with categories such as Technology, Learning, or Hobbies.
- **Memory Persistence**: Store your memories across sessions to carry context for ongoing conversations.
- **Copy All Data**: Copy your entire set of memories into a JSON format and use it to inject context into new LLM conversations.
- **Filter Memories**: Filter stored memories by text or tags to quickly find the context you need.

## Use Cases and Practical Examples

### 1. **Learning Progress Tracker**
   - **Example**: As you study new topics, you can add entries like "I learned Python" or "I am improving my skills in data science".
   - **Tags**: Skills, Technology, Learning
   - **How It Helps**: When you interact with an LLM, you can provide your learning history, which improves the LLM’s understanding of your knowledge base and enables better, context-aware answers.

### 2. **Personal Facts and Preferences**
   - **Example**: Save important personal facts like "I enjoy hiking" or "I prefer early morning meetings".
   - **Tags**: Personal Facts, Preferences, Hobbies
   - **How It Helps**: The LLM can recall personal preferences to provide more personalized responses in future interactions, such as recommending activities or adjusting the tone of the conversation.

### 3. **Work History and Goals**
   - **Example**: Track your professional milestones and future goals, like "Completed my first project at Company X" or "Goal: Learn cloud computing".
   - **Tags**: Work History, Goals, Career
   - **How It Helps**: When interacting with an LLM, your work history and professional goals can be referenced to provide tailored career advice or project management tips.

### 4. **Mindset and Self-Improvement**
   - **Example**: Record entries like "I am focusing on improving my mindset" or "Struggling with work-life balance".
   - **Tags**: Mindset, Self-Improvement, Productivity
   - **How It Helps**: With the LLM having context on your mindset and self-improvement goals, it can offer advice that aligns with your current priorities and challenges.

### 5. **Health and Well-being**
   - **Example**: Track your health-related milestones such as "I started exercising daily" or "Struggling to sleep well".
   - **Tags**: Health, Well-being, Productivity
   - **How It Helps**: When the LLM has access to your health and well-being context, it can provide more relevant advice on managing stress, improving sleep, or maintaining healthy habits.

## How to Get Started

1. **Create New Memory**: Enter your thoughts or notes into the input box and tag them with appropriate labels.
2. **Save Your Memories**: Once you've added your memories, they will be automatically saved for future use.
3. **Copy All Data**: Click the "Copy all user data" button to copy your entire set of memories in JSON format.
4. **Use in LLM Conversations**: Paste the copied JSON data as context in your preferred LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.), allowing the model to use the memories to improve the conversation.

## Roadmap

### **Q1 2025**
- Implement advanced filtering options for memories.
- Enable import/export of memory data to and from other platforms.

### **Q2 2025**
- Expand memory tagging system with custom tag creation.
- Enhance user interface for easier navigation and memory management.

### **Q3 2025**
- Introduce memory sharing options for collaborative work.
- Begin integrations with popular LLM APIs for automatic context injection.
