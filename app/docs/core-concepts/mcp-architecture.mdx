# Memory Context Processing (MCP) Architecture

The Memory Context Processing (MCP) architecture is a core feature of our platform that enables intelligent memory management, context awareness, and real-time data synchronization across your organization.

## Key Components

### 1. Memory Management
- **Centralized Storage**: All memories are stored in a unified repository with metadata and embeddings
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Changes are immediately propagated across all connected clients
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Advanced search capabilities using semantic embeddings

### 2. Context Awareness
- **Dynamic Context Building**: Automatically builds and maintains context based on user interactions
- **Project Relationships**: Intelligently links related memories and projects
- **Context Visualization**: Interactive visualization of memory and project relationships

### 3. AI Integration
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides contextually relevant suggestions based on current work
- **Automated Tagging**: Uses AI to categorize and tag memories for better organization
- **Semantic Search**: Leverages embeddings for more accurate search results

## Features

### Real-time Status
The MCP Status indicator shows the current state of your connection to the MCP system:
- ðŸŸ¢ Connected: Fully operational and syncing
- ðŸŸ¡ Connecting: Establishing connection
- ðŸ”´ Disconnected: No connection to MCP services

### Context Viewer
The Context Viewer provides a visual representation of:
- Memory relationships
- Project connections
- Current context state
- Real-time updates

### AI Suggestions
The AI Suggestions system offers:
- Context-aware recommendations
- Related memory suggestions
- Project linking opportunities
- Best practice reminders

## Implementation

### WebSocket Integration
```typescript
// Initialize MCP client
const mcpClient = useMcpClient();

// Handle real-time updates
mcpClient.onMessage((message) => {
  switch (message.type) {
    case 'CONTEXT_UPDATE':
      updateLocalContext(message.payload);
      break;
    case 'SUGGESTION':
      showAiSuggestion(message.payload);
      break;
  }
});
```

### Context Management
```typescript
// Update context with new memory
async function addToContext(memory) {
  const enrichedMemory = await prepareMemoryForMcp(memory);
  await mcpClient.sendMemory(enrichedMemory);
}

// Query context
async function queryContext(query) {
  const results = await mcpClient.queryContext(query);
  return results;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Context Updates**
   - Keep the context fresh with regular updates
   - Remove outdated or irrelevant information
   - Monitor context size for optimal performance

2. **Memory Organization**
   - Use consistent tagging conventions
   - Group related memories in projects
   - Maintain clear relationships between items

3. **AI Integration**
   - Review and act on AI suggestions promptly
   - Provide feedback to improve suggestion quality
   - Use AI-assisted tagging for consistency

## Configuration

The MCP system can be configured through environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_HOST=https://mcp.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_VERSION=v1
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify MCP service status
   - Review WebSocket connection logs

2. **Context Sync Problems**
   - Clear local cache
   - Force context refresh
   - Check for version mismatches

3. **AI Suggestions Not Appearing**
   - Verify AI service connectivity
   - Check suggestion threshold settings
   - Review context quality and size

## Security Considerations

The MCP architecture implements several security measures:

1. **Data Protection**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure WebSocket connections
   - Regular security audits

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Fine-grained permissions
   - Audit logging

3. **Privacy**
   - Data minimization principles
   - Configurable retention policies
   - Privacy-preserving AI processing
