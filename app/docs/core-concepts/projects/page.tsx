                    In xmem, projects help you organize your knowledge into distinct categories. Projects allow you to keep
                    related memories together, whether for personal use or team collaboration. A project can hold many memories,
                    and you can easily switch between projects to stay organized.

                <p className="leading-7">
                    A project is a container for your memories. It helps group related pieces of knowledge under a common theme.
                    For example, you can have a project for personal notes, work-related documents, or a team project you’re
                    collaborating on. Projects make it easy to manage different areas of your knowledge.

                <p className="leading-7">
                    To create a project, follow these simple steps:

                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>Go to the <strong>Projects</strong> page.</li>

                <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight pt-4">Managing Projects</h2>
                <p className="leading-7">
                    After creating your project, you can manage it by adding memories, editing the project’s details, or
                    deleting it if it's no longer needed. Each project can have a unique set of memories and tags, making it easy
                    to stay organized.
