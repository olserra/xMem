# [ADR-20250604-112800] Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) into xmem

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-06-04 11:28:00 UTC
- **Context:**
  - xmem is a context memory/context manager for LLMs and agents, currently exposing all operations via API.
  - The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a standard for context exchange and memory management in LLM/agent ecosystems, enabling interoperability and modularity.
  - Adopting MCP will allow xmem to integrate more easily with other tools, frameworks, and agents that support MCP, and future-proof the platform.
- **Decision:**
  - Implement an MCP adapter in `src/backend/adapters/` to translate MCP requests to xmem orchestrator calls.
  - Expose a new API endpoint at `/api/mcp/` that accepts and returns MCP-compliant payloads for context operations (store, retrieve, update, delete).
  - Document the MCP interface and usage in project docs.
- **Consequences:**
  - xmem will be interoperable with other MCP-compatible tools and frameworks.
  - Standardizes context exchange, making integration and extension easier.
  - Minimal disruption to existing abstractions due to alignment with MCP concepts.
- **Related:**
  - [MCP Spec/Docs - to be linked]
  - Other ADRs on memory/context management (if any)
