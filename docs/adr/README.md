# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project. Each ADR documents a significant architectural or technical decision made during the project lifecycle.

## How to use

- Every deploy (pipeline run) automatically generates a new ADR file with a timestamp and deploy info.
- ADRs are written in Markdown and stored in this folder.
- The codebase is the source of truth for all decisions.

## ADR Template

See [`template.md`](./template.md) for the ADR template.

## ADR List

<!-- The list of ADRs will be auto-generated or manually maintained here. -->
